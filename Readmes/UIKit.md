# UIKit

KeyboardKit comes with a bunch of built-in view and components that help you build `UIKit`-based keyboard extensions.


## Tutorial

If you're new to KeyboardKit, [this short tutorial][Tutorial] can help you get started.


## Overview

`UIKit` is the old, standard way of building custom keyboard extensions. You can setup your extension with constraints to make it resize to the size of your keyboard.

KeyboardKit simplifies this setup (which can be pretty complicated) and can manage constraints by using a stack view that you can populate with any views you like.

You can use any `UIKit` views you like to build your keyboard. You can then use any of the built-in views and extensions to add keyboard functionality to your views.

From KeyboardKit 3.0, `SwiftUI` will be the main focus moving forward. SwiftUI support will be improved over time in 3.x. KeyboardKit 4.0, will then drop support for iOS 11 and 12 and move everything from [KeyboardKitSwiftUI][KeyboardKitSwiftUI] into this library.


## Views

KeyboardKit has many UIKit views that can be composed into UIKit-based keyboards:

* `KeyboardButtonView` implements `KeyboardButton`. It's a regular `UIButton` that can be setup with a primary and secondary action. 
* `KeyboardSpacerView` implements `KeyboardButtonRowComponent`. It's a regular `UIView` that can be used to add additional spaces between components in a button row.
* `KeyboardButtonRow` implements `KeyboardStackViewComponent` and displays buttons horizontally within its `buttonStackView`. The stack view is a regular `UIStackView` that can be customized in any way you like. 
* `KeyboardToolbar` implements `KeyboardStackViewComponent` and displays views horizontally within its `stackView`. The stack view is a regular `UIStackView` that can be customized in any way you like. 
* `KeyboardCollectionView` implements `KeyboardStackViewComponent`. It's a regular `UICollectionView` that can be customized in any way you like. However, since it contains very little logic, you can use the `KeyboardButtonCollectionView` and `KeyboardButtonRowCollectionView` subclasses to get more features out of the box.

Since these views are regular views, you can use them in your hosting application as well.


## Components

Since layout is much more complicated in UIKit than in SwiftUI, KeyboardKit also has many UIKit component that can be composed into UIKit-based keyboards:

* `VerticalKeyboardComponent` describe components that can be added to a vertical flow, e.g. a vertical stack view. It has a height constraint that.
* `HorizontalKeyboardComponent` describe components that can be added to a horizontal flow, e.g. a horizontal stack view. It has a width constraint.
* `KeyboardStackViewComponent` specializes `VerticalKeyboardComponent` and describe components that can be added to the main `keyboardStackView`.
* `KeyboardToolbarComponent` specializes `HorizontalKeyboardComponent` and describe components that can be added to toolbars.
* `PagedKeyboardComponent` can be implemented by any view that display pages of keyboard buttons, e.g. collection views. It has functionality for persisting and restoring the current page index.

Take a look in `UIKit/Views` and `UIKit/Components` for a complete list of views and components.
